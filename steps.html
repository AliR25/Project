        <p>I always start drawing the torso. The reason is that the torso dictates the whole position of the body. Once you have the torso and the hips placed, to draw the head and the limbs become way easier.</p>

        <p>Drawing the hips will be the next step. I usually draw the hips and the crotch like if our dummy was wearing a short swimsuit or male underwear. It simplifies the process creation and makes things easier to understand.
        Take notice the distance from the belly button to the crotch area equals another head</p>

        <p>Once I have the torso and the hips in place, I will move forward and start drawing my limbs. First of all, will be the shoulders. Iâ€™ve seen many people drawing the shoulder like a couple of egg-shaped spheres. In my case, I do the same, but I also like to draw the top part of this inverted egg flatter. The reason is this allows the descending line of the traps to continue on the deltoids. The result is a more natural and fluid body line. For the biceps and triceps area, I will draw a tube for each arm. This tube will become narrower on the bottom. Here will be connected to the elbow. Drawing the elbow and the forearms. Next the elbow will be situated on the same height of the floating ribs, on the sides of the torso. For the forearms, we will draw also a tube for each arm. Like before, they will become narrower on the bottom part. In this case, the bottom part will be the wrist. More or less, both wrists will be aligned with the crotch on the hips area. For not over complicate this process too much, I will draw the hands as two fists. I will draw them quite schematically. For the fist placed frontally we will draw a big irregular square for the palm. The fingers will be drawn as little rectangles. For the hand placed sideways, the main body of the hand will be a rectangle and the fingers again will be drawn as single squares. Later on, you can define better the fingers, the knuckles, etc.. but for now is more important to focus on the big picture and have a well-proportion figure in general</p>

        <p>The next chapter on our journey will be to draw the legs. For each thigh will draw a thick tube. This tube will connect the hips with the knees. The same way we did for the arms, these tubes will become narrower on the bottom area where the thigh connects with the knee. This time the distance from the crotch to the kneecaps will be 2 heads. The lower leg. Below the knees, we will find the shins and the calves. This lower part of the leg will be drawn differently depending on the position of the legs. The leg drawn frontally will present two sides: The exterior side. This side will be drawn with a very short curve line on top and a long curve line under, which will end on the feet. The interior side. This side will have a similar distribution. It will present a curve line on top and another one under. The curve line on top will be longer than the one on the exterior side, but still shorter if we compare it with the curve line bellow that follows until it reaches the feet.</p>

        <p>The feet will be represented as geometric shapes. The one placed frontally to the viewer can be easily understood if we draw it like an isosceles trapezoid. In the case of the feet placed sideways, this one will be easily understood if we draw it like a scalene triangle. Remember the interior side of the feet is more concave in shape, and the exterior side will be more convex.</p>

        <p>For the head, we will draw a sphere which will represent the cranium and the face. This sphere will be placed on top of the ellipse we drew for the neck. Under the sphere, we will draw a square. This square will be the jaw of our dummy. Once we have the head placed, we will connect it to the body drawing the neck. We will draw a horizontal curve across the sphere. This curve will cross the middle of the sphere and will define where the eyebrows will be placed. Following this same line, we will draw the ears on the side of the sphere. Then we will divide the whole head with another vertical line. Remember our head is in a 3/4 view, so both parts will have different sizes as we did for the torso. And just like that you're done with your human figure. From here on, you cna add whatever you'd like to the figure.</p>
