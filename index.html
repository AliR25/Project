      <h1>How To Draw Human Anatomy</h1>
      <p style="background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.2);"> Welcome to this step by step tutorial. Here you will learn how to draw the human body from a 3/4 view. I choose this view because the majority of tutorials teach you how to draw a person from a front or profile view. This is useful of<br> course, but your final drawing will look too flat and rigid. The most common view used in drawings is the 3/4, especially if you are a concept artist. This view gives a real sensation of depth and three-dimensionality to the characters. Drawing great anatomy helps artists create realistic-looking figures that appear to have actual mass and volume.</p>
