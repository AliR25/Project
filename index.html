      <h1>How To Draw Human Anatomy</h1>
      <p style="background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.2);"> Welcome to this step by step tutorial. Here you will learn how to draw the human body from a 3/4 view. I choose this view because the majority of tutorials teach you how to draw a person from a front or profile view. This is useful of<br> course, but your final drawing will look too flat and rigid. Not only will I show you how to draw full body anatomy, but I will also show you how to draw heads/faces as well. I will show you how to draw a face from the front, side and 3/4 view. It may seem challenging at first, but drawing heads/faces should be easy as pie after you get the proportions down.</p>
