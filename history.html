      <h1>Anatomy Drawing's Importance</h1>
      <p>The study of human anatomy, for artists, can be as simple and straightforward as learning about proportions and working from life, or as involved and complex as mastering an understanding of the skeletal, muscular, and surface structure of the human body. Artists pursue anatomy drawing to learn how to draw a human form as it appears in various positions or postures. Oftentimes, anatomy for the artist revolves around creating detailed anatomy drawings and anatomy sketches that can be referred back to in the studio. </p>
